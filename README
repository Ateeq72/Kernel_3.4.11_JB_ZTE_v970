This is the kernel Source code for the ZTE V970 / V970M / Smart a18 (MEDIATEK MT6577)
Linux 3.4.11


Building the Kernel:
********************
cd to kernel dir
********************

- Run script "./build.sh ztev970" to begin with the build process.

- Run script "./build.sh clean ztev970" to clean the project


  Once finished, you will find:
  - The new kernel file in the root folder ./build_result/kernel/kernel
  - The compiled modules in the root folder ./build_result/modules/*.ko

- Rename the "kernelFile" to "zImage" and repack with ROM RamDisk
